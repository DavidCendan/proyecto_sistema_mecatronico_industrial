When you want to add a Variable to a Class:
First config (xml add value)
Add in Data Classes
    add to the struct
    add to read the config
Add in save Xml
Add in connection Class
Add to the Class Diagramm (Draw.io)
Add to if needed to the other Diagramms (Draw.io)
Add to your Class of course
Always needs to be Named the same! (Watch out easy to make mistakes)
